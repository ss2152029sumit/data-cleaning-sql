**Project Description: Data Cleaning in SQL on World Layoffs Dataset**

This project focuses on performing essential data cleaning operations using SQL to prepare a dataset for analysis. Data cleaning is a critical step in data management, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the dataset by addressing common issues like duplicates, inconsistent formats, and unnecessary columns. 

**Key Objectives:**
1. **Removing Duplicates**:  
   Identified and removed duplicate records based on primary and composite keys to maintain data integrity and eliminate redundancy.

2. **Standardizing Dates**:  
   Transformed and standardized date formats across the dataset to ensure consistency, making it easier for further analysis and reporting.

3. **Handling Null or Blank Values**:  
   - Replaced null values with meaningful default values or aggregated statistics (e.g., averages or medians) where applicable.  
   - Removed records or flagged entries with excessive missing data for further inspection.

4. **Dropping Unnecessary Columns**:  
   Identified and removed irrelevant or redundant columns that do not contribute to the analysis or insights, improving database performance and clarity.


**Technologies Used**:  
- **SQL**: MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQL Server for writing efficient queries to clean and transform the data.  
- **Database Management Tools**: Tools like MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, or SQL Server Management Studio for data exploration and query execution.  

**Project Highlights:**
- Applied advanced SQL techniques such as `DISTINCT`, `GROUP BY`, `CASE`, `COALESCE`, and `ALTER TABLE` to clean the dataset.  
- Ensured data quality by validating changes through sample queries and pre/post-cleaning comparisons.  
- Documented the entire cleaning process for transparency and reproducibility.

This project demonstrates expertise in handling messy data, a critical skill in data analysis and database management roles. The cleaned dataset is now ready for further exploration and visualization, enabling actionable insights and informed decision-making.
